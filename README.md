These are all accepted solutions - some of which ae what I came up with and most others being adaptations of the best solutions on LeetCode Discuss.

This Cordova/PhoneGap app is built as many HTML files that are dynamically built using a script that scrapes the problem/question content as well include the solution from [another repository of solutions](https://github.com/floydpink/online-judge) using [a node.js script](https://github.com/floydpink/online-judge/blob/9c39443c612e958e77709a8a7ca75743f09b47e8/leetcode/generateHTML.js).
